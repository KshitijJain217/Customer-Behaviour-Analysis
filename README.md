# 🛍️ Ecommerce Customer Behavior Analysis & Prediction  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes ecommerce customer behavior data to uncover insights, identify key factors influencing spending, and predict purchasing decisions. Using **machine learning models**, we evaluate customer satisfaction, spending patterns, and the likelihood of future purchases. The work includes **data preprocessing, visualization, regression & classification modeling, and feature importance analysis**.
